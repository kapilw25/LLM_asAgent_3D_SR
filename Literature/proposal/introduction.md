We’ve just turned 𝗡𝗬𝗖 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗼 𝗮 𝗽𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗔𝗜 𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 — a live sandbox where dozens of AI agents learn to move, talk, coordinate, and survive in a complex urban world.

This NYC sandbox is where we start stress-testing the 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹 questions:
🔀 𝗛𝗼𝘄 do agents move, talk, negotiate, and adapt when the world is messy
🌐 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 emerges when dozens of agents share the same streets—do they cooperate, compete, or collide?
🛡️ 𝗛𝗼𝘄 do we keep them safe, aligned, and socially aware while they learn in a live city?

This is our 𝗔𝗜 𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗴𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗲𝗻 𝗶𝗻 𝗡𝗲𝘄 𝗬𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗖𝗶𝘁𝘆 — and we’re just getting started.

🎥 Demos, tech breakdowns, and papers coming soon… stay tuned.
